# City Streetlight Energy Consumption Analysis 🌃💡

## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes **city streetlight energy consumption data** using **Python and Pandas** to identify **peak usage hours**, understand consumption patterns.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* Analyze hourly streetlight energy consumption
* Identify **peak energy usage hours**
* Highlight the **top 3 peak consumption periods**
* Visualize consumption trends using line plots

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

* **Python**
* **Pandas** – data analysis
* **Matplotlib** – data visualization
* **Jupyter Notebook**

---

## 📂 Dataset

* **File:** `intelligent_streetlight_dataset.csv`

---

## 🧪 Methodology

1. Load and inspect the dataset
2. Convert timestamp column to `datetime` format
3. Extract **hour of day** from timestamps
4. Compute **hour-wise average energy consumption**
5. Identify **peak usage hours**
6. Visualize trends using a **line plot**
7. Extract **Top 3 peak energy consumption hours**

---

## 📊 Key Analysis Performed

* Summary statistics of energy consumption
* Hour-wise average energy usage
* Line plot of **Average Energy Consumption vs Hour**
* Identification of **Top 3 Peak Hours**

---

## 🔍 Results & Insights

* Energy consumption is minimal during daytime hours
* Consumption increases significantly after sunset
* Peak energy usage occurs during late evening and night
* Top 3 peak hours represent the **critical optimization window**

---

## 📈 Visualization

* Line plot showing hourly energy consumption trend
* Helps clearly identify peak and non-peak hours

---

## ✅ Conclusion

The project successfully identifies peak energy consumption hours in city streetlight systems.
The results highlight the importance of **data-driven decision making** in smart city energy management.
